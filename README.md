## Dashboard Elements

The dashboard was designed in Tableau, which is popular in the analytics and business intelligence sphere. The dashboard is designed to fit in a typical browser screen for a PC or Laptop. It comprises of several visuals and other components such as filters and search bar for interactivity purposes.

### KPI Card 1 - Total Dollar Amount of Transactions

The total sum paid by all customers in their transactions was close to 200,000 US dollars.

### KPI Card 2 - Total Transactions Made

The sum of the transaction amount was distributed over 510 transactions made by each different customer.

### KPI Card 3 - Median Amount of Transactions

The final KPI card shows the median value for the amount paid by customers. The distribution of the amount varies a lot from one customer to another. Hence, the median is a better measure of central tendency in this case.

### Filter 1 - Filter by Region

The first filter of the dashboard was implemented on all of the worksheets/visuals shown above. It is a dropdown menu that allows end users to get isolated views of the metrics based on the region where the customers live *(North, South, East and West)*. Since the dropdown menu allows multiple selection, users can also filter by multiple regions at the same time.

### Filter 2 - Filter by Customer ID

The second filter of the dashboard allows end users to get a more detailed and specific look on each individual customer. This filter is also a dropdown menu but only allows single selection to preserve dashboard layout and spacing. Once a customer ID is selected, a table appears showing the customerâ€™s payment type, product and the amount they paid in the transaction.
